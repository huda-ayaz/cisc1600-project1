            <p class="bio">My name is Huda Ayaz and I am currently a junior at Brooklyn College majoring in Multimedia Computing. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and now live in Long Island. My first experience with coding was in my 9th grade of high school, when I took an Intro to Programming class and thought I would never touch programming again. And yet throughout high school, I found myself coding in many places, often where I would not expect it. </p>

            <p class="bio">My name is Royta Iftakher and I'm a senior at Brooklyn College majoring in Computer Science, with a minor in Multimedia Computer Science. I'm from Queens, New York, but I've lived in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and even the bronx for a short period of time. The first time I ever programmed something was in 10th grade, where I took AP Computer Science Principles. In that course I worked with Scratch and Processing and after passing, I never considered I would be coming back to them again all these years later. I've got a love-hate relationship with programming. I love seeing the fruits of my code, but I absolutely hate when something doesnt work and I have to spend hours researching why! Lucky for me, I enjoy it more often than I'm frustrated.</p>
